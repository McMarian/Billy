Whether it's wages, equipment and rent or marketing, research and regulations money are always needed and at the beginning investors are hard to spot. So our idea is to use crownfunding in order to get things going at the beginning. What does this mean? It means that no matter if you are Elon Musk or Jerome Kerviel (aka the poorest man in the world), you get to invest as little/more as you want. You might be familiar with that guy that bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. Well, if you ever get to read this you might end up like that guy, because worst case scenario you didn't eat 2 pizzas. But imagine having 10,000 Bitcoins nowadays. Heck even 1 Bitcoin will be better than 2 pizzas. But I'll bet you if you are going to invest in this, because one day, whether you invest or not, you will use this app. Everyone in the world will. Think for a minute how big is that... So if you are not to hungry or you are only a pizza hungry follow the link bellow and you be directed on Crowncube (the website that will allow you to invest in Billy). If you haven't decided yet read this one more time.</p>
